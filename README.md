# Where's Waldo? (phototagging-app)
## What it does?
This is an app insipred by the popular game 'Where's Waldo?', where you have to find Waldo and his friends in a photo cluttered with many other characters. This particular version of the game lets you choose between 4 photos. Every photo has a list of characters that you have to find, which will be displayed at the top of the photo. After you click the 'Start' button, a timer will start running until all the characters are found. After that, you can choose to register your score in the leaderboard for that specific level and you will be taken there to see which position you occupy.
## Techonolgies used:
* React
* React Router
* Firebase
* CSS

I have used functional React Components and Firebase firestore to store all the photos and all the leaderboard entries.
## How to run the app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```
Or you can simply visit the [live page](https://anabargau.github.io/phototagging-app/).
## What I learned
This project really helped me in my journey of mastering Firebase and after finishing it, I can confidently say that my skills using Firebase really improved. I learned how to initialize an app, how to initialize firestore for that specific app, how to log entries in that database and how to retrieve data from it. Ia also worked with mouse and photos coordinates for the first time.
Also, I improved my skills of using React Router because of all the paths and links used and also because of actually having two navigation bars. 

Overall, I thought it was a fun and challenging project, where I also put my designer skills to test.
